        <br />
        <p>My first undergraduate Computer Science project was water droplet simulation in under 100 lines of code. This project demonstrates an understanding of ArrayLists, loops, classes and privacy within classes. I created a 2D scene with water droplets hitting the screen and falling down over time. The droplets are created in an ArrayList of droplets. When the class is constructed, their x, y, radius, lifespan and x direction noise bias are randomly generated. As droplets fall, if they collide with other droplets, the bigger droplet will grow in size, have a modified bias and have an increased lifespan. As a droplet nears the end of its lifespan, the droplet will decrease in size until it is no longer visible. Non-visible droplets are removed from the ArrayList to save on resources.</p>

        <p class="lead text-center">A remake of the classic Arcade game of Space Invaders</p>
        <br />
        <p>As part of the first year IN1007 module, I was taked with creating a simple game in Java. I decided to re-create the classic Arcade game of Space Invaders, which includes Aliens, a player and bullets. This coursework involved extensive commenting and JavaDoc usage, learning a new library given by the client (the university) to be used and following to strict guidelines and criteria to create a game that satisfies the client. As the player completes each level, the game will move onto the next which is slightly more challenging. When the player completes Level 4, the game ends.</p>
